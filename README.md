<p align="center"> I am an enthusiastic learner and a passionate coder, with an interest in cybersecurity. Currently I am pursuing a B.Tech. degree in Computer Science trade from Rajkiya Engineering College Sonbhadra. I am just a beginner learning C++ and basic fundamentals of programming and aim to master all the concepts there are to learn. I like participating in coding competitions as they challenge me to learn more every time I come across a new problem. In my free time I also like to spend time with nature and love watching the sky paint in wonderful colors as the sun sets everyday. </p>
